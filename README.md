Downloads a random Wikipedia article, and reads the fist sentence of the summary. It will then type it out, and hit enter. Sending it.

## Installation
- You need Node.JS installed
- Clone it down
- run `npm i`


## Running it
- If you run `node index.js` or just open `run.bat`, it'll run the script. But see the notes for some info about running it

## Notes

- I set this up to work with my Elgato Streamdeck, so actually running the script might cause wierd things if you are unable to run it while having your desired chat window focused.
- There is no chance to review what it sends. It just sends. No I will not change it, but you can.
